  PlayerResponses:
  - '[Again? I already inspected the truck yesterday.]'
  - '[You got it, boss!]'
  ManagerReplies:
  - Yes, again. You are meant to inspect it before every trip. You never know what
    you might have missed or if something broke while you were driving unless you
    check every time!
  - Always remember to check the truck before heading out. You might have missed
    something last time, and sometimes things you had fixed can get broken again
    while driving too.
